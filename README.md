for this assignment we are going to make a simple console calculator in C++.

Your calculator program should make sense to use.
I should not have to look at your code to know how to use your program.

It needs to get a math operation from the user then perform that operation on numbers from the user.
It should after displaying the result loop and ask again.

Your program should support
-addition
-subtraction
-multiplication
-division
